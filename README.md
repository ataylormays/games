Battleship is a console app. To run, execute the BattleshipGame.java file. The origin of the board is 0 0 in the top left; the x-axis runs to the right and the y-axis runs down. Shots should be entered as space separated x-y pairs, eg '4 5', which would fire 5 to the right and 6 down.

Checkers is a console app that outputs a png file of the board layout each turn; to continue playing simply close the picture. To run, execute the checkers.py file. Each move should be entered as 'Starting square, ending square', eg 'A5, B6'. Double jumps, triple jumps, etc can be achieved by entering all moves as comma-separated squares, eg 'A4, C6, E8'.
